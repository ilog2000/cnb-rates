## Currency Converter

This is a simple web application to convert a limited number of currencies basing on currency exchange rates from the Czech National Bank (Česká národní banka, ČNB).

The application is built with React and TypeScript. Vite `create app` template was used to start it.
```shell
npm create vite@latest cnb-rates -- --template react-ts
```

Third party packages:
`react-query @mantine/core @mantine/hooks @mantine/form`

To run the application locally, clone the repository and run:
```shell
npm run dev
```
